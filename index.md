Hello, world! My name is Saskia Leymann and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, researching the prosodic features of irony and satirical speech in political contexts.

My main interests lie with the production and processing of non-literal language as well as the communicative effects achieved through such language. I also have a deep interest in data science, especially model development and visualization.  
In my free time, I hike, study data science and programming, and play tabletop rpg games with my friends.

On this site, I will introduce myself and my current projects.
